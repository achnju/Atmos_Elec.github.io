Hello everyone, this is my personal website. I am currently conducting research in the field of atmospheric electricity under the guidance of Dr. Pu at Nanjing University. My usual hobbies are listening to music, play badminton and table tennis. I also enjoy reading novels and hiking. My 
favorite foods are beef soup and fried potato chips from my hometown. Welcome everyone to contact me and exchange research progress and insights in the field of atmospheric electricity. I will work hard and keep working hard!


Atmospheric electricity
======

Atmospheric electricity is a branch of science that studies various electrical phenomena in the Earth’s atmosphere and the physical mechanisms behind them, including electric fields, magnetic fields, charge distribution, and their interactions with atmospheric processes. A global electric 
circuit exists between the Earth’s surface and the upper atmosphere, formed by the surface, the troposphere, the stratosphere, and the ionosphere. Under fair-weather conditions, a stable vertical electric field is maintained between the ground and the ionosphere, while during thunderstorms, 
sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and other special weather events, local electric fields undergo significant changes, leading to the occurrence of lightning, corona discharges, sprites, and other transient luminous events. Atmospheric electricity focuses not only on these macroscopic phenomena,
but also on the microscopic mechanisms of charge generation and transport, such as the charging of cloud droplets and ice crystals, and the dynamics of charge separation. Closely related to meteorology, space physics, and environmental science, this discipline plays an important role in 
lightning forecasting and protection, climate change research, and atmospheric chemical reactions such as nitrogen oxide production. With the advancement of high-precision detection technologies and satellite observations, research on atmospheric electricity is expanding from traditional 
ground-based measurements to global, multi-scale integrated monitoring, providing new scientific foundations for understanding the evolution of the Earth’s electrical environment.
